    "text": "I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, specialising in the intricate relationship between musculoskeletal motion, muscle stimulation, and (human) performance.\nMy approach combines experimental work with advanced musculoskeletal models and optimal control techniques. These biophysical models allow me to derive predictions that would be (near-)impossible to obtain through experiments alone, which I then thoroughly test in experiments.\nThis intertwined approach helps me investigate the fundamental physiological mechanisms that drive performance. My goal is to contribute meaningful insights to biomechanics and sports science, and, hopefully soon, rehabilitation.\nIn addition to my scientific work, I’m deeply interested in the history of muscle mechanics. I collect books covering the work of early pioneers. For a list of books I own (and hope to own), please see here."
